    <h2>What is Arch?</h2>
    <p>Arch Linux is a rolling release distribution. That means new kernel and application versions are rolled out to you as soon as they are released.</p>
   
   <p>The same goes for software. If a new version of software in the Arch repositories is released, Arch users get the new versions before other users most of the time.</p>
    
    <p>Everything is fresh and cutting edge in the rolling release model. You donâ€™t have to upgrade operating system from one version to another. Just use the pacman command and you always have the latest version.</p>
